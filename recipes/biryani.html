        <h3>About <em>Biryani</em></h3>
        <p>
            <em>Biryani</em> is a bit of a project and is time-consuming, but I've never been 
            disappointed with the results. Since, it is such a festive dish, I usually make it for dinner parties.
            It's always a <strong>big</strong> hit.
